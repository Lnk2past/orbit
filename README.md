# orbit

A composable, modular, and extensible modeling &amp; simulation microsystem for educational purposes

## Introduction

Over the years I have amassed a lot of code (in various stages of completeness) from teaching scientific computing and data visualization courses. I want to take all of my lessons learned, all of my tools, and all of what makes teaching fun for me and put it out there for others to learn from and use. This project will consist of a lot of different components to enable learning scientific computing, data visualization, C++, Python, and much more.

The `orbit` project will consist of the following (but not limited to!):

* algorithms & structures
* light, simple, and extensible physics engine
* light simulation framework complete with event scheduler
* C++ -> Python framework bindings
* Python Dashboards for visualizing simulations in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensions
* Analytical tools. visualizations, and notebooks

I have nearly a decade's worth of code and projects to sift through, and so not only will it take time to locate some code, it will take additional time to clean that code to modern standards and fit it into the `orbit` microsystem.

More to come!
